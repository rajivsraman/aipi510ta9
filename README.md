# AIPI 510 - Team Assignment 9
## Rajiv Raman

This is a public GitHub repository housing the code for my personal website (https://aipi510website.onrender.com). I set up a web service through Render that reads the main branch of this repository, so any changes made here can be easily reflected on the website following a simple re-deployment.

My website is fairly easy to use, as there are two main activities to do there:
1. Try your hand at randomly generated math problems from the AIME competition
2. Watch videos of levels I beat in the rhythm-based game Geometry Dash

The UX was an important point of this assignment, and I tried my best to make the website look nice while also maintaining functionality.

Because the website is publicly available, there are no testing instructions for using it. However, if you are interested in cloning the repository and attempting local deployment, all you need to do to test the website is to evaluate the **app.py** file as a Python script (without changing any of the directory organization).
